      My name is Clark Brace and as of the creation of this webpage, 
      I am a Junior attending the University of Puget Sound. I am a Computer Science student. 
      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games as well as a myriad of outdoor activities 
      including hiking, biking, and kayaking along with others. A personal project I am working 
      on at the moment is making my own version of the classic computer game Minesweeper with some
       new features which I think will improve the game.
